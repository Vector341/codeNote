关于 `Boolean() && || if()` 

falsy truthy



if() 会调用 Boolean() 进行类型转换



&& 

Here's the syntax of the `&&` operator in a chain:

```
operand1 && operand2 && ... && operandN
```

The expression is evaluated as follows:

> Starting from left and moving to the right, return the *first* operand that is *falsy*. If no falsy operand was found, return the *latest* operand.

Let's see how the algorithm works in a few examples.

对于特殊情况

```o
operand1 && operand2
```

如果第一个操作数是对象 则返回第二个操作数

如果第二个操作数是对象，只有第一个操作数求值为 true 才返回第二个操作数



Here's a generalized syntax of `||` operator in chain:

```
operand1 || operand2 || ... || operandN
```

The evaluation of `||` happens this way:

> Starting from left and moving to the right, return the *first* operand that is *truthy*. If no truthy operand was found, return the *latest* operand.

`||` works the same way as `&&`, with the only difference that `||` stops evaluation when encounters a truthy operand.
